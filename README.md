# Leggett-Garg-Inequalities-for-continuously-monitored-quantum-systems
Code for simulating the stochastic master equations which describe the evolution of a double quantum dot system continuously measured by a point contact detector. The resulting trajectories are then used to calculate the two times correlation function and the Leggett-Garg factor.
